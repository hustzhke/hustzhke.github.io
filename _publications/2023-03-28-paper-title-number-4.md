This paper addresses the importance of incorporating various risk measures in portfolio management and proposes a dynamic hybrid portfolio optimization model that combines them. The authors utilize quantile optimization technique and martingale representation to develop a closed-form portfolio policy that allocates higher positions to risky assets in favorable market states and lower positions in unfavorable ones. The results demonstrate improved Sharpe ratio and reduced downside risk compared to benchmark models.
